                Time Management
              </strong>

              Set a time limit for your gaming sessions and stick to it. Take regular breaks to maintain a healthy
              balance in your life.

                Know Your Limits
              </strong>

              It is important to set limits on your gaming activities. Only gamble with money you can afford to lose. We
              encourage our users to take regular breaks and to set personal limits to avoid the risk of excessive
              gaming.

                Self-Exclusion
              </strong>

              If you feel that gambling is negatively affecting your life, we encourage you to consider self-exclusion.
              Many online casinos provide self-exclusion tools that allow you to block your account temporarily or
              permanently.
